# GameOfLife-UE

I tried UMG uniform grid approach, but eventually decided to work with 3D cubes

Space key pauses or resumes simulation
Click on cubes to toggle between alive and dead
Field size, time interval between updates and spacing between cells can be adjusted in SpawnerComponent of BP_GOLGameState under "Spawner Component" category
